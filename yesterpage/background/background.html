    <!-- THE STURCTURE

        The structure of the DOM-stored data is as follows:
            tabs
                tab[id]
                    page[id, title, url, favIconUrl]
                        page[id, title, url, favIconUrl]
                            page[id, title, url, favIconUrl]
                            ...
                        page[id, title, url, favIconUrl]
                        ...
                tab[id]
                ...

        In other words,
        * `tabs` may contain `tab`s that have an id that is equal to the id of the tab they represent as given in the
          `chrome.tabs`.
        * Each `tab` contains only one and one page that has an `id` (tab-local serial integer), `title` (might be empty
          string), `url`, and a `favIconUrl` (might be empty string).
        * Each `page` may contain multiple other `page`s. The hierarchical structure means that a child `page` is
          visited from/after the parent `page`.
