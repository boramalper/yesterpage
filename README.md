The way we humans seek information does not strictly adheres to the
[Standard Boolean model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Boolean_model) that consist of a chain of boolean
statements, but more of
[_Berrypicking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_models_of_information_retrieval#Berrypicking):

> Bates argues that searches are evolving and occur bit by bit. That is to say, a person constantly changes his or her
> search terms in response to the results returned from the information retrieval system. Thus, a simple linear model
> does not capture the nature of information retrieval because the very act of searching causes feedback which causes
> the user to modify his or her cognitive model of the information being searched for. In addition, information
> retrieval can be bit by bit. Bates gives a number of examples. For instance, a user may look through footnotes and
> follow these sources. Or, a user may scan through recent journal articles on the topic. In each case, the user's
> question may change and thus the search evolves.

__yesterpage__ is intended to support and encourage _Berrypicking_ model by keeping track of all the webpages you have
been in a dendroid form that denotes whence you arrived a page and whither you proceeded.
